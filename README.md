# Project Demo
A live demo of the project can be found at [this address](https://node-snake-game.herokuapp.com/).
 
# Todo
- add smartphone controls to play
- add favicon
- use cache to keep trace of scores
- generate canvas color scheme on page load
 
# Known Issues
- in multiplayer game, if one of the players have internet issues, snakes positions could possibly be different in both clients ; it comes from the fact that server send to clients ***directions*** and not ***positions***. It might be done in an upcoming version.
- Multiple hits on the "restart" button increases the framerate, then gets back to normal after game over.
- canvas visual proportions are document-size dependent (it can currently shrink because of right side buttons)
